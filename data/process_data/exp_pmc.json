Visual fields normal; skull X-ray: enlarged sella. Diagnosed with acromegaly and partial hypopituitarism. Further radiation (4000 rad), testosterone replacement. GH normalized, later developed hypothyroidism and hypoadrenalism; replacement therapies started. Fourteen years later: elevated GH (25 μg/L), CT: partially empty sella, no tumor. Bromocriptine therapy (discontinued due to side effects). No surgery due to prior irradiation. Eighteen years later: progressive enlargement of hands, feet, nose; GH 104.5 μg/L; CT: sellar mass. Attempted transsphenoidal exploration abandoned due to failed intubation. Octreotide therapy started, dose increased to 500 mg three times daily by continuous infusion; GH reduced to 14.5 μg/L but not normalized.
