They were diagnosed with tonsillitis at the hospital and initially treated with intravenous amoxicillin (penicillin) for two days, which was ineffective. Subsequently, they were switched to azithromycin yesterday, but today the baby developed vomiting and diarrhea. From last night until this afternoon, there was no fever, but now there is a slight low-grade fever in the evening. The baby refuses to eat, and we are unsure what to do. The baby vomits immediately after eating anything, with vomiting occurring 5-20 minutes after eating. There was one loose stool in the afternoon, accompanied by frequent foul-smelling gas and gurgling sounds in the stomach. The baby can only drink small amounts of water. The mother is concerned whether the vomiting and diarrhea could be related to the azithromycin IV, noting that only one dose was administered and the treatment was stopped today. She wonders if azithromycin has such severe side effects and if it could damage the digestive system. The mother is also considering whether formula milk would be appropriate instead of regular milk.\n\nDiagnosis: The patient is presenting with fever, likely related to the ongoing tonsillitis infection, with secondary gastrointestinal symptoms possibly due to medication side effects or concurrent gastroenteritis.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Maintain adequate hydration with oral rehydration solutions or IV fluids if necessary.\n2. Temporarily discontinue all milk products and solid foods until vomiting subsides.\n3. Continue probiotics if tolerated.\n4. Monitor temperature and symptoms closely—return for reevaluation if symptoms worsen or persist beyond 24 hours.\n5. Consider alternative antibiotic options if tonsillitis symptoms persist after the current treatment course.\n\nMedical Evidence:\n- Fever and tonsillitis are common causes of low-grade and high fevers in infants.\n- Azithromycin, like other antibiotics, can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, although these are generally mild.\n- Gastroenteritis can present with similar symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort.\n- Discontinuing milk products and solid foods can help reduce gastrointestinal irritation and allow the digestive system to rest.\n- Oral rehydration solutions are crucial to prevent dehydration, especially in infants who may not tolerate large volumes of fluid well.", "category": "Infectious Diseases"}

She inquires whether she can use fructooligosaccharides or inulin alongside senna leaves or choose one over the other, expressing concern about potential dependency issues. She wonders which option might be more effective. \n\nBased on her symptoms, the patient is diagnosed with chronic constipation. To address her condition, I recommend trying fructooligosaccharides or inulin as dietary supplements to help with bowel movements. Additionally, incorporating gentle abdominal massage and maintaining a fiber-rich diet with vegetables and fruits may improve her condition. If her symptoms persist, further evaluation and alternative treatments may be necessary. Medical evidence supports the use of fructooligosaccharides and inulin in managing constipation by promoting the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, which can enhance bowel regularity.", "category": "Digestive System Diseases"}

Ultrasound and blood tests were conducted, showing no signs of pancreatitis, enteritis, or other significant abnormalities. Multiple oval hypoechoic nodules were observed around the mesentery, with clear boundaries and uniform internal echoes, and these were deemed within the normal range. The child has been diagnosed with intestinal spasms, which may be exacerbated by cold exposure. A warm compress provided initial relief, but the pain has persisted, particularly in the afternoons. Rubbing the abdomen helps alleviate the discomfort. The child has been taking probiotics and lactobacillus tablets, but the pain continues. The child has not been eating much, leading to irregular bowel movements, and a glycerin enema administered the day before yielded minimal results. The child's mother is concerned about potential digestive system issues and the duration of recovery. She mentions that her own stomach issues include difficulty with spicy foods but are generally manageable. The child has not been exposed to colds, and blood tests showed normal white blood cell counts. The mother is considering testing for Helicobacter pylori, noting that the symptoms could be related to this infection. The child experiences irritability and crying during pain episodes but no coughing. Based on the symptoms and examinations, the child is likely experiencing periumbilical pain due to intestinal spasms or other digestive issues.

Vestibular hypofunction refers to a dysfunction of the vestibular system, which is part of the inner ear and plays a crucial role in maintaining balance and spatial orientation. This condition can indeed be related to neurological issues, as the vestibular system is closely linked to the brainstem and cerebellum.\n\nFor treatment, I recommend taking Gastrodin Capsules and Pingxuannin Capsules or Merislon, along with vestibular rehabilitation exercises. These medications are known to help manage symptoms associated with vestibular hypofunction by reducing inflammation and improving circulation within the inner ear. Vestibular rehabilitation exercises, such as the Epley maneuver and canalith repositioning procedures, are designed to reposition displaced crystals in the semicircular canals, thereby alleviating dizziness and improving balance.\n\nSurgery is generally not the first-line treatment for vestibular hypofunction unless there is a specific underlying condition such as a benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) that does not respond to conservative treatments.

The mother is concerned about whether the green stools could be due to poor iron absorption or if they are a serious issue. Additionally, the mother mentions that the baby was born with an asymmetrical lower lip, which has since improved and is now barely noticeable when the baby is lying down. She is unsure if this is a nerve issue or if it is related to the green stools.", "category": "Digestive System Diseases"}

{"self_report": "42 days ago, I licked the nipple of a massage woman (for less than a minute in total), and she masturbated me. No other activities occurred. I’m certain she wasn’t pregnant, and there were definitely no obvious large wounds, but I’m unsure about small ones. I’m very worried she might have had minor bleeding or small wounds.

The patient's mother has offered to accompany them for a 4th-generation test to alleviate their fears, but the patient remains hesitant and scared. The patient's anxiety is so severe that it affects daily life, including interactions with others and even basic tasks.

The patient expresses concern about whether regular exercise will prevent the pain from recurring in the future.\n\nBased on the symptoms described, the diagnosis is lower back pain, likely caused by cold exposure or strain-induced ligament inflammation. To aid recovery, the patient is advised to avoid cold exposure, overexertion, forceful bending, and lifting heavy objects. Heat therapy and the use of flurbiprofen cataplasms externally are recommended. Additionally, ibuprofen or etoricoxib can be taken for pain relief if needed.", "category": "Neurological Disorders"}

He has been taking lansoprazole, domperidone, and sucralfate oral suspension for a week, which provided significant relief. However, he later switched from lansoprazole to pantoprazole for five days, but today, he feels that his mouth is particularly sour, accompanied by some chest pain. The patient has been taking the medications regularly as prescribed by the county hospital. His meals yesterday included noodles and corn grits porridge made with mung beans and peanuts. He has been eating approximately the same amount as usual. In the past, Chinese herbal medicine has helped with his stomach issues, but this time, despite taking proton pump inhibitors for over half a month, the effect has been poor. He takes lansoprazole once daily and pantoprazole once daily. He had an endoscopy last year, which showed verrucous gastritis with bile reflux. He inquires about switching to rabeprazole, whether he can stop the other medications, and the timing for an endoscopy and Helicobacter pylori test. He also asks about Chinese herbal medicines with similar effects and the duration of use. His tongue coating is described as slightly yellow and greasy. He mentions having a box of cisapride and plans to finish it before considering a switch.\n\nBased on the patient's symptoms and medical history, it appears he may have a gastric ulcer. The persistent bitter and sour taste, along with stomach pain after meals, are consistent with conditions such as gastritis or peptic ulcer disease, especially given the presence of bile reflux. The recommendation is to continue the prescribed medication regimen, avoid frequent switches, and schedule an endoscopy and Helicobacter pylori test after stopping the medication for a month. Monitoring symptoms and adjusting the diet to avoid irritants is advised.", "category": "Digestive System Diseases"}

The patient notes that the pain is not felt throughout the entire head but is localized to the right frontal region. There is no associated fever, cold, or other systemic symptoms. The headache began on the 28th of the lunar month, coinciding with a change in sleep patterns where the patient slept from 11 PM to 7 AM during that period and from 1 AM to 8 AM on New Year's Eve. The patient has no history of trauma and the pain remains consistent in location. The patient has not sought medical attention or taken any medication for this condition. The pain has recently become slightly more severe, prompting the visit. The patient is concerned about the possibility of neuralgia and asks about appropriate medication. The headache is constant but varies in frequency and intensity. Based on the patient's description, the symptoms suggest a possible primary headache disorder such as tension-type or migraine. Given the intermittent nature and location of the pain, further evaluation may be necessary to rule out other causes. For symptomatic relief, I recommend taking ibuprofen sustained-release capsules. If the pain persists or worsens, gabapentin can be considered. Additionally, the patient should focus on maintaining a healthy diet with more fruits and vegetables, avoiding catching a cold, ensuring adequate rest, and reducing smoking. If symptoms continue to worsen or persist, imaging studies may be warranted.", "category": "Neurological Disorders"}

Two days ago, you began experiencing constant headaches and dizziness, which started the day before yesterday. You feel feverish but have no actual fever. The doctor explained that these symptoms are likely due to post-operative wound healing and inflammation. Additionally, you mentioned that you had a tube placed in your ear, which is currently fine. Currently, you are experiencing throat pain, a left-sided headache, and dizziness. You find that even drinking water causes discomfort. Your doctor has informed you that recovery will take at least a month, and you are concerned about the duration and relief of your symptoms. You are seeking advice on dietary recommendations to aid recovery, whether you can use oral rinses, and if you should take cephalosporin. You are also curious about the cause of your headaches and whether intravenous (IV) treatment for inflammation could speed up recovery. You are currently managing your symptoms with regular anti-inflammatory medication.\n\nMedical evidence supports that post-operative headaches and dizziness are common due to inflammation and healing processes. Throat pain and difficulty swallowing are also typical during the recovery period. The use of oral rinses can help maintain oral hygiene and potentially reduce discomfort, but their specific benefits should be discussed with your healthcare provider. Cephalosporin antibiotics may be considered if there is a suspicion of infection, but this should be determined by your doctor based on clinical evaluation. Regular anti-inflammatory medications can help manage pain and inflammation, but the duration of symptoms can vary depending on individual healing rates. Recovery from throat surgery typically takes several weeks, and while improvement should occur gradually, significant relief may not be immediate.", "category": "Digestive System Diseases"}

Currently, the patient reports no pain in the hand, except for slight discomfort when pressing the palm against the ground, specifically in the marked area. The patient has a history of intermittent flare-ups where the pain would resolve on its own if ignored. The MRI images show an area that does not appear to be a cyst, but rather a possible site of incomplete healing of ligament damage, possibly accompanied by a small ganglion cyst. The patient has used Celecoxib capsules (Celebrex) 200mg for pain relief, but the pain persisted, leading them to continue with their daily activities until the pain subsided. The patient is concerned about the possibility of a more serious underlying condition and seeks further evaluation and treatment.
